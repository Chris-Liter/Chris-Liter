## I'm Jorge Lituma

### Computer Science Engineer

### Experience
- Experience with Software Development *Backend and Frontend*, microservices, Cloud Computing.
- Artificial Intelligence development for some areas, such as Medicine, Education, Research, and much more in *Deep Learning* for Computer Vision, Image Enhancement for research, and training of classification and detection models.
- The use of C++ or C for low level is for exclusive use for greater speed, used in my experience, both for backend and frontend

<!--### Proyects
- [Mobile Development with native libs C++]()
- [Alzheimer's Detection Model with published Article]()-->


### I'm passionate about Mobile Development, from Ecuador, with experience in proyects using `Flutter`, `Kotlin/Java`, `.NET MAUI`, and native development, creating native libraries in C++ for pixel manipulation with OpenCV, creating low-level filters with C++, implementing the TensorflowLite C++ API for Object Detection with `MobileNetV3` and more.

Worked on real-world projects with:
- `Flutter`, `Kotlin`, `Java`, `.NET MAUI`
- Native C++ libraries for OpenCV image processing
- Manual pixel manipulation and convolution filters in C++
- Integration of `TensorFlow Lite` C++ API for object detection (MobileNetV3, YOLOv11)


Software development is my forte and I love programming on my laptop, and when it comes to teamwork, I really enjoy it.

### ðŸ“‘ Articles and Repositories on Research
I have experience on research involving Artificial Intelligence, Software Development, Computer Vision and more.

* First article, titled "Alzheimer Diagnosis through Advanced Deep Learning Architectures and Interpretative Analysis of Predictions" where find the Development of deep learning models for early Alzheimer detection with a strong focus on prediction explainability and medical decision support.

This article was written in Springer Format, for the future publish on the Book `Proceedings of Tenth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology` from ICICT 2025, London.

Repository https://github.com/Chris-Liter/ServicioWeb-para-Modelo-Alzheimer with the Source code, and with process of training model.

* Second article, titled "A Pilot Initiative for Democratizing Artificial Intelligence Access in Public Education: Computer Recycling and Deep Learning Networks in Cuenca, Ecuador", very important such as a pilot project aimed at providing AI access through refurbished computers running deep learning models, promoting inclusive technological education in public schools.

This article was written in Springer Format, for the future publish on the Book `Communication and Applied Technologies` from ICOMTA'25, Chile.

Repository https://github.com/Chris-Liter/API-With-IA with the Source code, that contains the models trained using YOLOv11n implemented in the Flask API

* Thrid article, titled "RobertiÃ±o: A Low-Cost Robot for Executing Large Language Models and Convolutional Networks to Enhance Early Education in Underserved Communities", design and implementation of an educational robotic system integrating YOLO-based object detection and LLMs to support learning in marginalized regions.

This article was written in Springer Format, for the future publish on the Book `Communication and Applied Technologies` from ICOMTA'25, Chile.

Repository https://github.com/xDieGGox/Robbyapp, that contains the source code, about the mobile application, created with Kotlin and Java.
