## I'm Jorge Lituma

### Computer Science Engineering

### Experience
- Experience with Software Development *Backend and Frontend*, microservices, Cloud Computing.
- Artificial Intelligence development for some areas, such as Medicine, Education, Research, and much more in *Deep Learning* for Computer Vision, Image Enhancement for research, and training of classification and detection models.
- The use of C++ or C for low level is for exclusive use for greater speed, used in my experience, both for backend and frontend

<!--### Proyects
- [Mobile Development with native libs C++]()
- [Alzheimer's Detection Model with published Article]()-->


### I'm passionate about Mobile Development, from Ecuador, with experience in proyects using `Flutter`, `Kotlin/Java`, `.NET MAUI`, and native development, creating native libraries in C++ for pixel manipulation with OpenCV, creating low-level filters with C++, implementing the TensorflowLite C++ API for Object Detection with `MobileNetV3` and more.

Worked on real-world projects with:
- `Flutter`, `Kotlin`, `Java`, `.NET MAUI`
- Native C++ libraries for OpenCV image processing
- Manual pixel manipulation and convolution filters in C++
- Integration of `TensorFlow Lite` C++ API for object detection (MobileNetV3, YOLOv8)
